# gravitysim

A small simulator for gravity. Planets and velocities are defined in `data.json`.

Press up and down to change the timescale, left and right to change the zoom. WASD to move the camera around.
Camera zooming is still a little sketchy at the moment.

## Platforms

- Only tested for desktop.

## Gradle

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies.
The Gradle wrapper was included, so you can run Gradle tasks using `gradlew.bat` or `./gradlew` commands.
